\begin{frame}{The Fulbright Program}
\phantomsection\label{the-fulbright-program}
The Fulbright program was founded by United States Senator J. William
Fulbright in 1946 and has been considered one of the most prestigious
scholarships in the United States

The program provides approximately 8,000 grants annually, comprising
roughly:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1,600 grants to U.S. students,
\item
  1,200 to U.S. scholars,
\item
  4,000 to foreign students,
\item
  900 to foreign visiting scholars, and
\item
  several hundred to teachers and professionals.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Fulbright Specialist Program}
\phantomsection\label{the-fulbright-specialist-program}
Fulbright Specialist Program is open for U.S. academics and established
professionals to engage in two- to six-week, project-based exchanges at
host institutions.

Each year this program supports around:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  400 Specialist projects,
\item
  in 24 Eligible Disciplines
\item
  in 160 Countries
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My Role}
\phantomsection\label{my-role}
UniRemington's Fulbright Specialist application

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  called for a Fulbright consultant
\item
  with background in Innovation \& Creativity
\item
  to develop innovative protocols for courses conducted in their
  Innovation \& Creativity (LEGO) Lab
\end{itemize}

Otherwise there were really no constraints on my remit, and

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I found the University open to discussing all sorts of creative
  activities
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The ExL of LEGO Serious Play}
\phantomsection\label{the-exl-of-lego-serious-play}
LEGO workouts combine experiential learning (ExL) with various forms of
active learning such as action learning, adventure learning, free-choice
learning, cooperative learning, service-learning, and situated learning.

Experiential learning is distinct from traditional ``talking heads''
\emph{rote} or \emph{didactic} learning where the student is a passive,
and often disengaged participant

We wanted to find ways to expand on the basics explored in LEGO workouts

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  in search of scalable, asynchronous learning protocols
\item
  that will be attractive to the connected and interactive lifestyle of
  today's generation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Objectives of My Involvement}
\phantomsection\label{objectives-of-my-involvement}
Three particular objectives were agreed on early when I reviewed
activities in the Innovation \& Creativity (i.e., LEGO Serious Play)
Lab:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  improve \textbf{scalability} of courses in virtual, asynchronous
  teaching environments
\item
  develop \textbf{``experiential''} protocols for existing curricula to
  better attract and engage students
\item
  ultimately \textbf{help design and develop a ``library''} of
  experiential models for one week of material in a variety of classes
  in the business school, all housed in the university's Innovation \&
  Creativity Lab
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Brainstorming ``Interactive Experience'' at the Escape
Room}
\phantomsection\label{brainstorming-interactive-experience-at-the-escape-room}
Escape Rooms are hugely successful games

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  inspired by the Myst computer games of the 1990s
\item
  they are hugely popular, commercially successful and have engaged a
  wide range of audiences
\end{itemize}

They engage players in a physical environment with a sequence of time
constrained puzzles and an ultimate objective that varies with each game

\begin{flushleft}\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{escape} \end{flushleft}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Brainstorming ``Interactive Experience'' at the Escape
Room}
\phantomsection\label{brainstorming-interactive-experience-at-the-escape-room-1}
Here were lessons we could learn about successfully engaging players in
an ``experience''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  make the challenges visceral
\item
  facilitator remote monitors and only steps in when players are
  ``stuck''
\item
  communication is via a computer monitor, players are on their own
\item
  use a sequence of short workouts / puzzles (\textless10 minutes) to
  keep interest
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classroom Engagement and Protocols}
\phantomsection\label{classroom-engagement-and-protocols}
We asked ``What can we do with a course to create an exciting and
engaging student \emph{`interactive experience'}?''

In collaboration with the faculty, we decided to prototype the creation
of ``interactive experiences'' using the Innovation \& Creativity Lab
supporting three different 2-hour classes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Marketing mix and strategy
\item
  Colombian Economy and flows of money
\item
  Portfolio management
\end{itemize}

These selections cover a diverse set of topics assuring a wide buy-in by
university faculty
\end{frame}

Asynchronous, Automated}
\phantomsection\label{investment-in-colombias-future-experiential-asynchronous-automated}
\small

\textbf{Unlocks Potential of a Young, Energetic Workforce:} Colombia's
youthful population holds enormous potential to drive economic growth,
but they need access to relevant, high-quality education tailored to
modern industry needs.

\textbf{Bridges the Teacher Gap in Tech-Centric Fields:} With a shortage
of educators trained in current tech and industry practices, automated,
self-paced courses can scale high-demand knowledge to thousands without
overwhelming the teaching workforce.

\textbf{Expands Access Amid Limited Institutional Capacity:} Colombia's
educational institutions face capacity constraints, making it
challenging to meet the training demands of emerging industries.
Asynchronous courses allow students to learn on their own schedule,
overcoming space and resource limitations.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Investment in Colombia's Future: Experiential,
Asynchronous, Automated}
\phantomsection\label{investment-in-colombias-future-experiential-asynchronous-automated-1}

\textbf{Prepares for the Global Shift in Job Markets:} Rapid changes in
the global economy, such as automation, data-driven decision-making, and
digital services, are reshaping the job landscape. These courses provide
skills for the future, ensuring Colombia's youth can compete on the
international stage.

\textbf{Fuels Economic Dynamism and Export Capacity:} A workforce
skilled in tech and industry-relevant fields empowers Colombia to
diversify its economy, boost exports, and elevate its presence in the
global market, contributing to sustainable national growth.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Investment in Colombia's Future: Experiential,
Asynchronous, Automated}
\phantomsection\label{investment-in-colombias-future-experiential-asynchronous-automated-2}
\small

\textbf{Equips Colombia to be a Regional Leader:} By fostering a
well-prepared, tech-savvy workforce, Colombia can not only support its
own economy but also become a leader in Latin America, attracting
investments, talent, and innovation from around the world.

\textbf{Supports Lifelong Learning and Economic Resilience:} With
continuous access to industry-relevant knowledge, Colombians can adapt
to evolving industries over their careers, creating a resilient
workforce prepared to pivot as new opportunities emerge.

\textbf{Investing in these courses is more than education; it's a
strategy for long-term economic strength and global influence.}
